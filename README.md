# Next.js + Material UI + Node.js Application

This is a full-stack web application built with Next.js for the frontend, Material UI for the UI components, and Node.js for the backend. The goal of this project is to deliver a highly responsive, feature-rich web application while maintaining a zero-budget approach.

## Tech Stack:
- **Frontend**: Next.js (React - TypeScript) + Material UI
- **Backend**: Node.js
- **UI**: Material UI for modern, sleek components
- **Hosting**: Free tier services (Netlify, Vercel, or similar)

## Features:
- **Full-stack**: API integration with a Node.js backend
- **Responsive Design**: Built using Material UI for a seamless experience across devices
- **Budget-Friendly**: Created with zero-budget tools and services
- **Optimized**: Leveraging the power of Next.js for SSR and fast performance

Contributions and suggestions are welcome!


### This is still WIP and I will update the README as the project progresses.
